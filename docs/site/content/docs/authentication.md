Why do we require authentication for a free API? One major issue weâ€™ve encountered is ðŸ¤– BOTS consuming the entire daily request limit. To prevent this, we enforce authentication.

To authenticate, youâ€™ll need to create an account using your mobile phone number. This is because temporary phone numbers are harder to generate than temporary email addresses.
