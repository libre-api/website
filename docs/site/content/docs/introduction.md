Libre API is a versatile, developer-friendly edge-function API offering free access to multiple services. It delivers high-speed, high-quality APIs, supported by official and community SDKs, empowering developers without compromising performance.

## How does it work?

We leverage the [Cloudflare's Workers platform](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) to deliver lightning-fast edge-function responses. By harnessing Cloudflare's extensive network of [global data centers](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/network/), we ensure low-latency, high-performance API access for developers worldwide. This infrastructure enables seamless, scalable service delivery, maintaining speed and reliability without compromising quality. Official and community-driven SDKs further simplify integration, empowering developers to build efficiently with our free-to-use, high-speed API ecosystem.

## Why is it free?

At Libre API, we believe developers shouldn't face unnecessary barriers when building web applications. It's frustrating to hit a paywall for essential features, especially for straightforward functions like address lookups, exchange rate data, or geolocation services. While some specialized APIs, such as payment processing, may require paid solutions, many core utilities should be freely accessible. 

Libre API provides a robust, free-to-use platform, powered by Cloudflare's high-speed Workers and global data center network. Our goal is to empower developers with reliable, high-quality APIs without cost constraints, supported by official and community SDKs for seamless integration. By removing financial hurdles, we enable innovation and creativity to thrive, making development more inclusive and efficient.

**We kindly encourage users who rely on our services to consider making a donation. Your contributions help us maintain and enhance the platform, ensuring our developers can continue delivering high-quality, accessible APIs without financial strain. By supporting Libre API, youâ€™re investing in a vibrant, inclusive developer ecosystem.**
